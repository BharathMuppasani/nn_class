validation loss and training loss

This plot illustrates the training and validation losses of a neural network model over 15 epochs, trained on the MNIST dataset. The blue line represents the training loss, while the orange line depicts the validation loss. Initially, both losses decrease sharply, indicating rapid learning. As epochs increase, the rate of decrease in loss slows down, stabilizing towards the later epochs. The convergence of training and validation loss suggests that the model is generalizing well without significant overfitting. The close convergence of training and validation losses indicates effective learning without overfitting, demonstrating the model’s proper training.


Confusion matrix:
The confusion matrix displayed here evaluates the performance of a neural network model on the MNIST test set. Each cell in the matrix represents the number of instances of the true labels (rows) predicted as each class (columns). For example, the model predicted 968 instances of the digit ‘0’ correctly, while it confused ‘5’ for ‘3’ eight times. High values on the diagonal indicate accurate predictions for most digits, with occasional confusions between visually similar classes like ‘4’ and ‘9’, and ‘3’ and ‘5’. This matrix helps in identifying specific weaknesses in the model’s digit recognition capabilities. The high accuracy and clear diagonal in the confusion matrix confirm that the neural network effectively recognizes and classifies handwritten digits.

The graph illustrates the training and validation losses over epochs for different configurations of hidden layer sizes in a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. As the network’s hidden layer sizes increase from [128, 64] in blue to [1024, 512] in purple, there is a noticeable reduction in both training and validation losses, particularly noticeable in the early epochs. This trend suggests that networks with more neurons in their hidden layers tend to learn more effectively and generalize better to unseen data, as evidenced by the closer convergence of training and validation lines with increasing layer sizes. However, it is important to note the potential for diminishing returns in performance improvements and the increased risk of overfitting with excessively large models. This visualization effectively demonstrates the trade-offs between model complexity and performance, providing a clear depiction of how increasing layer size can impact learning outcomes in neural network training.
